# Litorina Folkh√∂gskola

We are rebuilding the Litorina School website using Strapi as a headless CMS for content management and React for the frontend. This modern stack allows for a flexible, maintainable, and performant web experience.

## üìñ What the Project Is

This project is a modern web application for Litorina Folkh√∂gskola. It uses:
- **Strapi**: A headless CMS for managing content.
- **React**: A frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for the frontend.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development.

The backend provides a robust API for managing content, while the frontend delivers a responsive and interactive user experience.
